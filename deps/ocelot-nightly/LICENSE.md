ocelot: a language extension library
====================================

`ocelot` contains several libraries for which slightly different copyright
notices apply. Instead of providing several `LICENSE.md` files, the names of
all libraries are listed here with their copyright notices merged. They are
copied with a few changes for
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) from the `doxymain.h`
files in the libraries.

I do not wholly hold the copyright of this library; it is mostly held by David
Hanson as stated in his book,
